## <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133)"> Multilevel trust-region methods</span>

<div style="text-align: justify">Originally, the multilevel methods have been designed for elliptic partial differential equations. Their applicability to non-convex optimization problems was extended by utilizing the trust-region globalization strategy, giving rise to recursive multilevel trust-region methods (RMTR) [Gratton et al. ’08]. I have contributed to the development of RMTR methods by proposing several novel variants that take into account the structure of the underlying optimization problem in order to construct multilevel hierarchy and transfer operators. These methods are unique as they allow for the solution of complex non-convex minimization problems with multigrid efficiency. Moreover, they are also provably globally convergent, thus guaranteeing the success of the nonlinear iteration process.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Predicting damage and crack propagation is a long-lasting challenge in computational mechanics. The phase-field approach to fracture allows for predicting crack evolution without the need to explicitly model crack paths and therefore has become very popular. The development of an efficient phase-field fracture simulation framework requires scalable implementation of an underlying mathematical model and robust solution strategy. I have contributed to both aspects by implementing the finite-element phase-field fracture models and by proposing novel solution strategies for solving arising non-convex coupled constrained minimization problems. The developed simulation framework has been used to simulate brittle, conchoidal, and pneumatic fractures. More recently, it has been also employed for pressure-induced fracture propagation of stochastic fracture networks in 2D/3D, considering realistic scenarios with up to 1 000 fractures.</div>
