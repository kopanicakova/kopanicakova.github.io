I am currently <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)"> Visiting Scholar at Brown University</span> (Division of Applied Mathematics, CRUNCH group). 
My research visit is supported by the Swiss National Foundation via a Postdoc-Mobility grant entitled "Multilevel training of DeepONets - multiscale and multiphysics applications". 
Prior to joining Brown University, I was a <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">Postdoctoral Researcher at Universit√† della Svizzera italiana</span> (Euler Institute), from where I have also received a <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">Ph.D. in Computational Science</span>, under the supervision of Prof. Rolf Krause. 

As a computational scientist, I am involved in simulating real-life problems by developing mathematical and computational models using techniques from numerical mathematics, engineering, nonlinear optimization, and high-performance computing. My research focuses on the development of numerical methods, especially <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">multilevel and domain decomposition strategies</span>, for the solution of large-scale nonlinear optimization problems. Devised solution strategies were successfully applied in several fields including fracture mechanics, cloth simulations in animated films, inverse problems in cardiac electrophysiology, and more recently training of deep neural networks.
