## <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133)"> A phase-field approach to pneumatic fracture. </span>
<div style="text-align: justify">Phase-field models have been proven to be reliable methods for the sim- ulation of complex crack patterns and crack propagation. In this contribution we investigate the phase-field model in linear and finite elasticity and summarize the influences of model specific parameters. Furthermore, externally driven fracture pro- cesses, in particular in the context of pneumatic fracture, are examined in detail. The focus is on fracture induced by pressure and anisotropic crack growth. Besides the modeling, the solution process is analyzed by applying multilevel methods. Within a series of parametric studies and numerical examples the versatility of phase-field models is demonstrated.
