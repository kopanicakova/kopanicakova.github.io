I am currently <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)"> Visiting Scholar at Brown University</span> (Division of Applied Mathematics, CRUNCH group). 
My research visit is supported by the Swiss National Foundation via a Postdoc-Mobility grant entitled "Multilevel training of DeepONets - multiscale and multiphysics applications". 
Prior to joining Brown University, I was a <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">Postdoctoral Researcher at Universit√† della Svizzera italiana</span> (Euler Institute), from where I have also received a <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">Ph.D. in Computational Science</span>, under the supervision of Prof. Rolf Krause. 

As a computational scientist, I am involved in simulating real-life problems by developing mathematical and computational models using techniques from numerical mathematics, engineering, nonlinear optimization, and high-performance computing. My research focuses on the development of numerical methods, especially <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">large-scale multilevel and domain decomposition strategies</span>, for the solution of partial differential equations. Devised solution strategies were successfully applied in several fields including <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">fracture mechanics</span>, <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">cloth simulations</span> in animated films, inverse problems in <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">cardiac electrophysiology</span>, and more recently <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">training of deep neural networks</span>. 


<!-- Currently, my research focus is given to exploring the relationship between numerical modeling and machine learning.  In particular, my goal is to investigate the potential of machine-learning approaches for modeling real-life problems, but also to explore new research directions in machine learning by applying the latest numerical approaches.  -->
