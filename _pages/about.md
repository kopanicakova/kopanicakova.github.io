<div style="text-align: justify"> I am currently an Associate Professor (Maître de Conférences) at the <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)"> University of Toulouse (Toulouse-INP/ENSEEIHT)</span> and a member of the Parallel Algorithms and Optimization (APO) team within the <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">IRIT Laboratory</span>. I am also affiliated with the <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)"> Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (ANITI)</span>, where I hold the international research chair, dedicated to the hybridization of AI and large-scale numerical simulations for engineering design. </div> <hr>

<!-- <div style="text-align: justify"> Before moving to Toulouse, I spent two years at <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)"> Brown University</span> in the Division of Applied Mathematics, working in the CRUNCH group led by Prof. George Karniadakis. My research was centered around the "Multilevel Training of DeepONets - Multiscale and Multiphysics Applications" project, supported by a Swiss (SNF) Postdoc-Mobility grant. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133, 0.75)">Università della Svizzera italiana</span>, from where I also earned a Ph.D. in Computational Science under the supervision of Prof. Rolf Krause. </div> <hr> -->

<div style="text-align: justify">My research interests involve topics on the interface of numerical modeling, scientific machine learning, nonlinear optimization, high-performance computing, and engineering. </div>
