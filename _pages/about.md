I am currently Visiting Scholar at Brown University (Division of Applied Mathematics, CRUNCH group). 
My research visit is supported by the Swiss National Foundation via a Postdoc-Mobility grant entitled "Multilevel training of DeepONets - multiscale and multiphysics applications". 
Prior to joining Brown University, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Universit√† della Svizzera italiana (Euler Institute), from where I have also received a Ph.D. in Computational Science, under the supervision of Prof. Rolf Krause. 

As a computational scientist, I am involved in simulating real-life problems by developing mathematical and computational models using techniques from numerical mathematics, engineering, nonlinear optimization, and high-performance computing. During my Ph.D. studies, my research focus was given on the development of numerical methods, especially large-scale multilevel and domain decomposition strategies, for the solution of partial differential equations. Devised solution strategies were successfully applied in several fields including fracture mechanics, cloth simulations in animated films, and inverse problems in cardiac electrophysiology. My recent work targets the development of novel training algorithms for deep neural networks, with a particular focus on DeepOnets. 

I am currently interested in exploring the relationship between numerical modeling and machine learning by investigating the potential of machine-learning approaches for modeling of real-life problems, but also by exploring new research directions in machine learning by applying the latest numerical approaches. I envision enhancing advanced numerical and machine learning techniques by contributing to the development of powerful instruments such as nonlinear optimization methods, and multilevel solution strategies.
