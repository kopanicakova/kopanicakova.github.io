## <span style="color:rgb(199, 21, 133)"> DeepONet Based Preconditioning Strategies for Solving Parametric Linear Systems of Equations. </span>
<!-- <div style="text-align: justify">A class of multi-level algorithms for unconstrained nonlinear optimization is presented
which does not require the evaluation of the objective function. The class contains the
momentum-less AdaGrad method as a particular (single-level) instance. The choice of avoiding the evaluation of the objective function is intended to make the algorithms of the class
less sensitive to noise, while the multi-level feature aims at reducing their computational cost.
The evaluation complexity of these algorithms is analyzed and their behaviour in the presence of noise is then illustrated in the context of training deep neural networks for supervised
learning applications.
