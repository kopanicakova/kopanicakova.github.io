<!-- Applicant focuses on the development of globally convergent multilevel solution strategies for large-scale bound-constrained non-convex optimization problems. Originally, the multilevel methods have been de- signed for elliptic partial differential equations. Their applicability to non-convex optimization problems was extended by utilizing ideas from trust-region strategy, giving rise to recursive multilevel trust-region meth- ods (RMTR) [Gratton et al. â€™08]. The applicant has contributed to the development of RMTR methods by proposing several novel variants that take into account the structure of the underlying optimization problem in order to construct multilevel hierarchy and transfer operators. These methods are unique as they allow for the solution of complex non-convex minimization problems with multigrid efficiency. Moreover, they are also provably globally convergent, thus guaranteeing the success of the nonlinear iteration process. De- vised RMTR methods have been applied in various scientific fields, including fracture mechanics [J4, J1], cloth simulations in the animated film industry [J5], machine learning [J7], and cardiac electrophysiology [C1, J2]. -->
